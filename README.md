2.	The patient arrives at the hospital and checks in at the reception desk. The receptionist uses MEDNETICA to look up the patient's appointment and to print out a chart.
3.	The patient is seen by the doctor, who uses MEDNETICA to review the patient's medical history and to order any necessary tests.
4.	The patient has blood work and X-rays done. The lab and X-ray technicians use MEDNETICA to enter the results of the tests.
5.	The doctor reviews the results of the tests and discusses them with the patient. The doctor also uses MEDNETICA to prescribe medications for the patient.
6.	The patient goes to the pharmacy to have their medications dispensed. The pharmacist uses MEDNETICA to verify the prescription and to dispense the medications.
7.	The patient leaves the hospital, and their medical record is updated in MEDNETICA. 

MEDNETICA is a valuable tool for hospitals and clinics of all sizes. It can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital operations, and to provide better care for patients.
